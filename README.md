# Recycling-Project-with-AI-Based-Python-GUI
This project was developed as part of my AI coursework, focusing on applying Rule-Based AI to promote creativity in recycling. The dataset was manually created by gathering information from the internet about various recycling methods and compiling it into a CSV file. Due to my limited experience with Project Management at the time, the folder and file naming conventions are not well-organized. The project features a simple Python GUI that allows users to input different types of waste materials and receive suggestions on what creative works can be made from them. The aim was to combine AI with environmental awareness, encouraging innovative ways to upcycle waste.
